The `BESdata` package is meant to simplify getting data from some BES data sources into R - mostly for products of the Technical Services / Environmental Information Division. This guide will describe some simple use cases for using the package. The package can be installed using the [https://remotes.r-lib.org](remotes) package:

```{r install}
#| eval: FALSE
options(download.file.method = "wininet")
remotes::install_github("jasonelaw/BESdata")
```
For this guide, we'll use some other packages:

```{r setup}
#| echo: FALSE
library(BESdata)
library(sf)
```
